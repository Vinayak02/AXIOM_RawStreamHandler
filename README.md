# Raw Video Container Format - GSoC 2018

## Emulation - Stream Handling from AXIOM Beta

### Usage
- Clone the git repo to your local machine
- Make sure you have `cmake` and `g++` to build the system
- `cd` to local git repo and build the system using `./setup.sh` script
- Find the executables in the `bin` folder
- `cd bin` to go into the bin folder
- Run `./begin_emulation.sh` to begin emulation. (To be implemented)

**Note**: The emulation requires large chunks of memory to work with. Be sure to have `~5 GB` of RAM on your machine.
